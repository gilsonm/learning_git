This is a basic tutorial on using Git.

Central ideas in Git.

What Git does and why you should use it.

Git is a tool that allows you to save, track, and manage a file or project as it evolves over time. This is a good thing. You can use git at the inception of a project, or after it is already under way.

In either case, as the files in your project evolve, you can save snapshots of the files (and directory structure) with git, and have these snapshots available as you move forward. This makes it easy for you to revert to a specific snapshot of the project in case of emergency--accidents happen--or for other reasons--perhaps you intentionally removed a file (or section of a file) from the project earlier on and now you need it again.

The other great thing about Git is collaboration.
